    "**The Lotka-Volterra equations**\n",
    "\n",
    "_Refer to Exercise 8.2 in the Newman text._ The Lotka-Volterra equations are a mathematical model of predator-prey interactions between biological species. Let two variables $x$ and $y$ be proportional to the size of the populations of two species, traditionally called \"rabbits\" (the prey) and \"foxes\" (the predators). You could think of $x$ and $y$ as being the population in thousands, say, so that $x = 2$ means there are 2000 rabbits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Lotka-Volterra model the rabbits reproduce at a rate proportional to their population, but are eaten by the foxes at a rate proportional to both their own population and the population of foxes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{{\\rm d}x}{{\\rm d}t} = \\alpha x - \\beta xy,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are constants. At the same time the foxes reproduce at a rate proportional to the rate at which they eat rabbits-- because they need food to grow and reproduce-- but also die of old age at a rate proportional to their own population:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{{\\rm d}y}{{\\rm d}t}  = \\gamma xy - \\delta y,$$\n",
