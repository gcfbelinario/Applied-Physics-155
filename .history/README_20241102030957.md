I am currently a laboratory instructor for Applied Physics 155, working alongside Dr. Reinabelle Reyes to complement her lecture class. This repository hosts the laboratory assignment notebooks (LAM) designed for undergraduate physics students at the National Institute of Physics, University of the Philippines Diliman. I am updating the notebooks regularly with sample code implementations after each assignment deadlines to help students review and learn outside class hours.
